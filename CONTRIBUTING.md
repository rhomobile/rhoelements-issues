# Reporting RhoElements Issues

Found an issue with RhoElements or want to give your feedback?  Here's how!


## Reporting issues

We only accept issues that are bug reports or feature requests. Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems that we can fix within RhoElements. For application-specific or API-related questions, please visit our [Launchpad Disscussion Area](https://developer.motorolasolutions.com/community/rhomobile-suite/discussions/rhomobile-discussions). Please read the following guidelines before opening any issue.

1. **Search for existing issues.** We sometimes get duplicate issues, and you'd help us out a lot by first checking if someone else has reported the same issue. Moreover, the issue may have already been resolved with a fix available.
2. **Create an isolated and reproducible test case.** Be sure the problem exists in RhoElement's code.
3. **Include a live example.** An example in the form of an accessible GitHub repository or easily-usable code snippet and test case should be provided. The simpler and faster it is to reproduce the issue, the faster we can fix it.
4. **Share as much information as possible.** Include operating system and version, device, version of RhoElements and Rhodes, customized or vanilla build, etc. where appropriate. Also include steps to reproduce the bug.
